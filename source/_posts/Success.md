As of February 16, I have passed my Hack Reactor Technical Admissions Assessment (TAA) for the second time, and I have received an offer as an apprentice software engineer with PayPal once I complete Hack Reactor's intensive! I am proud to say that all of my hard work and dedication are paying off, and I am well on my way to my goal of becoming a software engineer with much to offer the field. :)
