# Welcome to my personal website!

Hello! My name is Milad Moulayi and I am a software engineer in training. I am currently enrolled in the coding intensive program Justice Through Code, and I am waiting to start the Hack Reactor intensive on March 27th. I am passionate about coding and I am constantly looking for new methods and techniques to create the best possible content. I hope you like what I have to offer!
